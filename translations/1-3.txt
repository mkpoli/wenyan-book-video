“Yes,” “or,” “not” —
these are words of utmost abstraction,
yet even people do not easily wield them.

Therefore, a balanced way was taken:
to imitate human speech,
choosing from it what is concise and essential;
to refine the script,
and to fix its meanings with rigor.

Thus, it stands high enough to be read and used by people,
yet low enough to be translated and understood by machines.
This is what is called a programming language.

In ancient times there were the Classics of Calculation;
in the Book of Changes there were the Appended Remarks —
though their purposes differed, the principle was the same.
