“If only those who love it may pursue it,
why should I learn it?”

It was answered:
“Even if not for practical use,
to study it refines the mind —
making one’s thought careful and far-reaching,
one’s judgment precise and clear.
That is one benefit.

Another lies in the joy of creation itself.”

Then he asked again:
“What joy can there be in programming?
All day one toils restlessly,
facing endless lines of symbols,
rushing to correct each mistake in haste —
how can that compare
to the pleasures of cockfighting, dog racing,
dice games, or passing cups of wine?”
