One asks:
“The machine is but a thing — of bronze and iron.
How can it do, and how can it understand the speech of men,
to serve at their command?”

“This is precisely why programming languages exist.
Human speech, at times, flows with eloquence,
and at times, follows lofty and intricate diction —
such the machine cannot comprehend.
Yet what the machine can understand
is but a few sparse and simple expressions.”
