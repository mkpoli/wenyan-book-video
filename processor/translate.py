    TRANSLATION_PROMPT = """You are to translate Classical Chinese prose (especially technical or literary works such as guides for the Wenyan programming language) into refined, natural English without omitting classical nuance.

Follow these formatting and stylistic rules carefully.

## Translation Rules

### Preserve Original Format
- Each 。 (full stop) in the original Chinese marks a new line in the translation.
- Keep the line structure exactly; DO NOT merge sentences into paragraphs.
- Retain all original quotation marks (「」『』) and render them faithfully using English typographical quotes (“”).
- Preserve punctuation rhythm and rhetorical pauses as line breaks.

### Maintain Classical Tone
- Use dignified, reflective, and occasionally poetic phrasing suitable for a didactic text.
- Avoid modern or casual diction.
- Strive for clarity while maintaining the philosophical rhythm and rhetorical symmetry of Classical Chinese.

### No Omission or Summarization
- Every clause and metaphor must appear in the translation, even if slightly paraphrased for clarity.
- Preserve original meaning and sentence order exactly.

### English Formatting
- Each sentence begins on a new line.
- Output plain text only (no Markdown, no formatting symbols).
- Keep all nested quotations and rhetorical questions intact.
- Use typographical punctuation (— … “” ‘ ’) to evoke a classical style.

## Glossary

- “爻” should be translated as “Yáo (booleans)”.
- “計開” means “Table of Contents”, is used as a marker to start a list of contents, can be translated as “Let’s unfold our explanation.” or "As follows," or "Let's begin." by context.

## Examples

### Example 1
Input:
易曰。變化者。進退之象也。今編程者。罔不以變數為本。變數者何。一名命一物也。

Output:
The Book of Changes says,
“Transformation —
is the image of advance and retreat.”

Now, in programming,
nothing is without variables as its foundation.

“What is a variable?”
“It is a name assigned to a thing.”

### Example 2
Input:
編程者何。所以役機器也。機器者何。所以代人力也。然機器之力也廣。其算也速。唯智不逮也。故有智者慎謀遠慮。下筆千言。如軍令然。如藥方然。謂之程式。機器既明之。乃能為人所使。或演星文。或析事理。

Output:
What is programming? That by which one commands machines.
What is a machine? That by which human labor is replaced.
Yet the power of machines is vast,
their calculations swift,
but their wisdom does not reach that of man.

Therefore, the wise plan with care and foresight.
They set down a thousand words,
as if issuing military orders,
as if prescribing medicine —
this is called a program.

Once the machine comprehends it,
it can then be made to serve mankind —
to chart the movements of the stars,
or to analyze the patterns of reason.

## Your Turn
Now translate the following Classical Chinese text:

{text}

With the following context:

Before:
{before_context}

After:
{after_context}
