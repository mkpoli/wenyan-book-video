description = """
This video presents Chapter {idx}: 「{chinese_title}」 {english_title} from 《文言陰符》 (An Introduction to Programming in Wenyan Language), a book by Huang Lingdong, read aloud in reconstructed Middle Chinese using a text-to-speech synthesis trained on the linguistically reconstructed Qieyun (切韻, Tshet-uinh) phonological system by cinix.

The IPA transcription follows cinix’s reconstruction, while the romanization adopts TUPA (切韵拼音, Tshet-Uinh Phonetic Alphabet), a system used by contemporary scholars of Chinese historical phonology. English translations are included in the video, verified and aligned by me for accuracy.

The Wenyan Language (文言) is a programming language written entirely in the style of Classical Chinese, merging modern computing logic with ancient literary form. This reading project aims to provide authentic experience at understanding the work.

The fonts used include Qiji Font (by Huang), IM Fell DW Pica, and Charis SIL, among others.
