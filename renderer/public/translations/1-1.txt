What is programming?
That by which one commands machines.
What is a machine?
That by which human labor is replaced.
Yet the power of machines is vast,
their calculations swift,
but their wisdom does not reach that of man.

Therefore, the wise plan with care and foresight.
They set down a thousand words,
as if issuing military orders,
as if prescribing medicine —
this is called a program.

Once the machine comprehends it,
it can then be made to serve mankind —
to chart the movements of the stars,
or to analyze the patterns of reason.
