The decision-maker.
The beginning of all wisdom.
What, you ask? It is said: observe before acting.
The way fish swallow one another.
One must first measure their size.
The dog’s biting.
One must first observe the master’s likes and dislikes.
This is the decision of beasts.
In rain, one dons a rain cloak.
In cold, one clothes oneself.
When the price is good, one sells.
When people are virtuous, they deceive.
This is the decision of the common man.
Reward and punishment; commendation and blame.
Attack plots and sever alliances.
The decisions of ministers and chancellors.
