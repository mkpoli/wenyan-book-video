Furthermore, a program is like a piece of writing.
If one merely jots down words at random,
its meaning will surely be incoherent,
and its errors many.

So too with programs: they follow the same principle.
When their structure flows smoothly
and their logic is clear throughout,
a reader may grasp their intent with ease,
and a machine may execute them without the slightest fault.
This is called craftsmanship.

Someone then asked:
“You speak of programming as a beautiful art indeed —
but I do not make my living by it.”
