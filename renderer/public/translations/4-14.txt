I have a word,
Say, “Though you are human, to me you are indeed straw-dogs.”
Write it down.

Or if the ‘Thing’ is equal to “Straw-dogs,”

I have a word.
Say, “There is no need to speak further”
Write it down.
If not,
I have a word.
Say, “I do not know what you are; yet your being straw-dogs is clear.”
Write it down.
Thus do.
