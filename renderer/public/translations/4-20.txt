There are also “not and (NAND)”.
“Not or (NOR)”.
“Exclusive or (XOR)”.
All can be derived from the combination of the previous three.
“NAND” —
means “two Ghaew has Yin”.
“NOR” —
means “two Ghaew are both Yin”.
“XOR” —
means “one Ghaew is Yin, the other is Yang”.
and the six operations can also be derived from “NAND”.
Thus we say,
“NAND” generates everything.
