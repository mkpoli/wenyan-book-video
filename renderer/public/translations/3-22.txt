I have heard a witty commentator annotate this interpretation as follows.
Now there exists one who can speak the language of beasts.
State his commands.
The pheasant stands by itself.
The rabbit stands upright.
The number of feet is half that of the heads.
Therefore, divide the feet by two.
This person also has an instruction:
The pheasant and the rabbit each raise one foot again.
Therefore, subtract it from the “head.”
The pheasant’s two feet are both raised.
They fall to the ground.
The rabbit still has one foot.
