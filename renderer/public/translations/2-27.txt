The guest said.
“Now I see.
One should view it thus.
All unnamed variables.
All unnamed variables are, as it were, like an otter’s sacrifice.
Those who speak of it.
Take the nearest fish and discard the rest.
The one who writes it down.
Write it all down.
The one who names it.
Take some and name them.”
He replies,
“So be it.
Well done, nice analogy.”
