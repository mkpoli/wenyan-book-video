Then repeat this “A” three times.
I have a phrase:
“Ask Heaven and Earth if They Are Well.”
Write it out
— and so on.
When it is run,
the result is: Ask Heaven and Earth if They Are Well.
Ask Heaven and Earth if They Are Well.
Ask Heaven and Earth if They Are Well.

Someone asked:
“Why say Ask Heaven and Earth if They Are Well?”

He replied:
“Because before programming,
the machine dwells in chaos and obscurity,
knowing not where Heaven and Earth themselves are.”
