“Code” — 
these are the written words of a program.
Sometimes only a few lines,
sometimes filling many scrolls —
it depends on the task.

A “compiler”
is itself also a program:
it translates the programming language
into a form the machine can understand.

To “run” a program
is to cause the machine, having understood it,
to then carry it out —
perhaps to compute a number,
or to perform an action.
