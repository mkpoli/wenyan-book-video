The questioner asked,
“Whenever there is an unnamed one,
They are sacrificed thus.
Would it not, in the end, be a ceaseless, manyfold piling?
Now I would discard all its fish.
And what should be written?”
He said,
“It should be written as ‘alas.’
‘Alas’ —
is a sighing utterance.
Thus one laments its thorough discard.”
