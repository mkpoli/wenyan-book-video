Moreover, as for division,
There is a distinction between the divisor and the dividend.
This is to say that division has no commutativity.
Now, to say divide A by B.
A —
is the dividend.
B —
is the divisor.
It may also be written as dividing with B to A.
There is no difference, is there?
Subtraction is likewise so.
And addition and multiplication have commutativity;
hence they are generally used.
Hence they are commonly used.
