…it says: “Ask Heaven and Earth if They Are Well.”
Then write it out.

The phrases ‘I have a number’ and ‘I have a phrase’ —
these both refer to kinds of variables.

A number is that by which one performs calculations.
A phrase is that by which one conveys words to people.
Each thing has its own kind and should not be confused —
just as a horse is not a deer,
and a human is not a spirit.

Thus we declare their types beforehand,
so that their nature may be made clear.
