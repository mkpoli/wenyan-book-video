Its applications are by no means limited in number.

One asks:
“The machine is
but a thing —
of bronze and iron.
How can it do, and how can it understand the speech of men,
to serve at their command?”

It is answered:
“This is precisely why programming languages exist.
Human speech, in its common use —
its words at times splendidly adorned,
its allusions at times profound and graceful.
such the machine cannot comprehend.
Yet what the machine can understand
is but a few sparse and simple expressions.”
