“Greater than,” that is,
to compare it.
“If,”
“If not,” that is,
to decide it.
“To add one to ‘Reserve,’” and so on,
is to do it.
To compare it yields its true value.
This must be the sentence that follows “if …”
It must not be the sentence that follows “if not.”
If it is “No,”
then the reverse.
Now, since forty-nine is not greater than fifty.
Proceed to the next sentence for the “not” case.
“Reserve” ends at forty-eight.
