the principle was the same.
Someone asked:
“What is most valued in a program?”
Answered: “Two things are prized —
One is ingenuity,
the other is craftsmanship.
When one sets out to accomplish a task,
there is never only a single plan.
Yet some ways double the effort and halve the result;
some paths are circuitous yet reach for the distant —
none of these are good strategies.
Therefore, those who program
must study their methods deeply.
When a method is excellent,
its calculations are precise,
its execution swift —
this is called ingenuity.”
