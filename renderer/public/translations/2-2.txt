Called by two names, yet in truth one.  
As for the distinction between persons and things.  
They are further divided according to class.  
Therefore: without a name there is no means to distinguish what is spoken of.  
Without a thing, there is no means by which to indicate what has been obtained.  
Without a class there is no means to know its use.
