The cycle, verily.
The sun and moon go their appointed rounds.
The flourishing and withering of grasses and trees.
The rise and fall of human affairs.
That is so.
King Bi Xuan said:
Heaven and earth have no beginning and no end.
In every 120,000 years, a Pangu appears.
Even now, after countless ages.
There is but one path in history.
Surely it is foreordained.
I know not whether it be folly.
Yet “Year after year, flowers look the same.”
People see it alike.
