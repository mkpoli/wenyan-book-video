“To say ‘three’ or ‘Ask Heaven and Earth if They Are Well’
is to assign a value to a thing.
Thus, when later one asks, ‘What is the number?’
it will know of itself that it is three.
The same holds for words.

To say ‘call it A’ —
is to give the variable a name —
just as a man may be named Zanghuo,
or a sword may be named Juque.
Hence, whenever one later speaks of Zanghuo,
all will understand it refers to that very man.”
