The Book of Changes says,
“Transformation —
is the image of advance and retreat.”

Now, in programming,
nothing is without variables as its foundation.

“What is a variable?”
“It is a name assigned to a thing.”

The thing itself may change,
yet the name does not.
Or the names may be many,
yet the thing remains one.

It is like leaves meeting autumn,
or a tiger leaving the mountain —
the thing changes, yet the name endures.

Or like Zhang Lu, who became Fan Sui,
and Sima Xiangru, who called himself Dog’s Son.
